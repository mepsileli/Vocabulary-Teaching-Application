To design the clothes, the Murray brothers traveled to the Chive offices in Austin, Tex., and shared stories about their days as loopers. The anecdotes are translated by William Murray Golf employees into concepts that the brothers refine — say, switching a print’s miniature golf carts to Eisenhower-era ones.

Bill came up with the line’s best seller, the shirt with the highball glasses. “He said: ‘What if some of the drinks are spilled? Sometimes drinks spill,’” Joel said. “We try to put a little whimsy and cleverness into it, and Bill is good at that.”

As Bill revealed in his 1999 book, “Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf,” there are advantages to dressing a little outrageously on the course. In explaining his wardrobe choices when he played the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournament, he wrote: “Today’s palette is central coast chameleon, nothing that would flush the fauna from the flora. Save the fine vines for later in the week, when they can serve to distract the gallery from my golf game.”

The brothers plan to introduce two collections a year and eventually expand into light jackets, blazers and pants. They are sticklers about the details, Joel said, recalling how shorts were sent back for a redesign after they discovered the pockets were too shallow.

“Deep pockets, that’s just something you need when you golf,” Joel said. “You want your balls to stay in your pocket — you don’t want things falling out the side.”
